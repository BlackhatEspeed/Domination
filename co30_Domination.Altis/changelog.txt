- Added: Players can now change the Earplugs and 3DMarker toggle keys in the status/settings dialog (you still need to set the user action key in the A3 key/control settings)
- Fixed: If some AI advanced features were enabled then a snipe awareness script was running every frame on the server
- Fixed: Stupid script error in fn_aftereject.sqf (yeah, suspending is not allowed in non scheduled environment)
