4.24

- Added: Max_camp_cnt_method mission parameter by longtimegamer
- Added: If a player (accidentally) places an explosive too close to a MHQ (< 9m) the explosive will be removed and put back into his/her inventory
- Changed: Make use of new triggerinterval stuff to run scripts at a specific time 
- Changed: Added setTriggerinterval as new parameter to createTrigger and createTriggerLocal functions (by alexvladn)
- Changed: Teamkillers are no longer pushed to the server lobby (slot selection) but they now can listen to a song in jail (something with bananas :))
- Changed: Updated Korean translation by kkim
- Changed: Launcher cooldown time is no longer set by launcher class name but is the same for all
- Changed: Removed searchlight from GMCWG version vehicles
- Changed: Always use BIS Virtual Arsenal instead of ACE arsenal if ACE is available (ACE arsenal causes issues when mods like GM run, loads vanilla A3 weapons too instead of only GM weapons for example)
- Changed: You can now select between
             - All camps captured and radio tower destroyed
             - Low number of AI units, all camps captured and radio tower destroyed
             - Low number of AI units and radio tower destroyed
           for "Seize condition for main target:" (d_ao_check_for_ai in description.ext).
           Second one is default (d_ao_check_for_ai = 1)
- Fixed: Added missing light attack chopper for independent side
- Fixed: Some SLA CfgGroup names and sections got renamed in the CUP update resulting in spawning no groups
- Fixed: CUP composition objects were spawned under or half in the ground
- Fixed: In the GMCWG versions enemy AI infantry didn't spawn because CfgGroups class names have changed
- Fixed: Some vehicles at base were placed half in the ground in the IFA3 version
- Fixed: When a player ejected with an ejection seat from an air vehicle on the ground it was still possible for an admin to unlock the vehicle via the isAdmin script and get into it
