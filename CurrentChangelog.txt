4.15

- Fixed: Player did not get extra points for helping solving the sidemission (score was added on the client not on the server; available in ranked mode and when SQL database is available)
- Changed: All cluster/subammo type magazines removed from mission pylon loadout dialog (including 3rd party mods). Causing much too much lag!!!
- Changed: Added more score messages to the new UI score message system
- Added: Chinese translation by 小新
- Updated: Russian translation
