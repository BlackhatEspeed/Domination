- Added: Boat patrols when sea or rivers are near a main target, by Lelik
- Fixed: Secondary weapons (launchers) got removed in arsenal/inventory even when they were valid weapons (stupid copy and paste error)
- Fixed: min/max spawn radius for guerrilla infantry spawn to avoid creating guerrillas too close or too far from maintarget
- Fixed: Side mission objects like radio towers were spawning in the air (at least in the UNSUNG version)
