- Added: Angry bots by longtimegamer (has to be turned on)
         There are four new AI settings for allmen and snipers bot behavior:
         - all enemy infantry bots: on an interval, reveal nearby players with "reveal 4" within configurable radius
         - all enemy infantry bots: on an interval, check line-of-sight with players and doSuppressiveFire if LOS or isVisible are true within configurable radius
         - all enemy infantry bots: on an interval, if _fired is true then frequently do "setAmmo 1" (this helps to balance new shooting behavior vs running out of ammo too quickly)
         - all enemy infantry bots which are free to move: on an interval, if bot is a leader then order the group to move to location of nearest player within configurable radius
- Changed: Wait 10 seconds before spawning the next enemy AI groups at barracks in the AO
- Fixed: Round camp capture time and clip progress capture bar when max value is reached
- Fixed: Some kick player to lobby messages still showed up
