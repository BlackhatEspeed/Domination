4.20

- Added: Parameters for enemy spawn radius for AI which occupies buildings
- Changed: Shorter names for some classes in CfgParams (note that you have to check your DB params too; best to recreate them completely)
- Changed: Make use of new triggerinterval stuff to run scripts at a specific time
- Fixed: Saving the player gear layout when closing arsenal to the server was missing side parameter which broke it
- Fixed: Sometimes dropped box markers did not get deleted
- Fixed: Removed binoculars from enemy AI group leaders so that they don't run around with a bino in their hands constantly
